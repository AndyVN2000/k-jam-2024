## Intro

This is our project for the K-jam 2024 event. The theme of the event was "Pirates".
Our game follows the general idea of timed-based action games like Overcooked, where several
tasks emerges and all demand the attention of the player. Our spin to this theme is a one-man
crew of a ship who has to manage all the challenges of operation a pirate vessel. The ship may
collide with rocks and cliffs, causing damage to the hull. The sole captain must repair the damage
all by himself.

Beware! Adversaries lurk in the perilous sea and may send an onslaugth of cannon fire against your
vessel. Return fire in kind while steering the sinking ship across the seven seas.
